# BeautifulSoup 4 Projects

I used the Jupyter notebook for my beautifulsoup projects you can use any text editor but you will not be able to view my code if you don't have jupyter notebook installed

## Download Juypter notebook:-
You can download the jupyter notebook as a conda package if you have conda installed(it's pre loaded with the anconda distribution but not with the miniconda distribution) use the command in your conda pompt * conda install jupyter notebook* this should succesfully download the notebook

Now to run the jupyter notebook type *jupyter notebook* in your conda prompt 


## Download Python 3.x :-
I made all of my projects using python3, it will be replaced in the future by its succesor but I belive the changes in the syntax will be minimal so if you have python vdersion other than 3.X look out for changes
